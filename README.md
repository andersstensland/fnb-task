# FjordLine Cabin Food Ordering App

This is a Next.js project designed for FjordLine, enabling passengers to order food directly to their cabins. It is built using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and enhanced with features from Sanity CMS for content management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn for UI components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project utilizes next/font to automatically optimize and load Google Fonts, ensuring optimal loading times and performance.

Features
Content Management: Integrated with Sanity CMS to manage the menu items, categories, and product details dynamically.
State Management: Uses custom hooks like useSyncedState to manage UI states, ensuring preferences are persistent across sessions.
UI Enhancements: Leveraging Shadcn and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface that enhances the user experience on mobile and desktop devices.
Accessibility and Usability: Focused on making the ordering process as easy and accessible as possible for all users.
